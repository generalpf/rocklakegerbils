<h2>About Us</h2>
<p class="centertext"><i><b>Rock Lake</b> was inspired by the camp location in <a href="http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca/visit/camping/rock-lake-campground.php">Algonquin Park in Ontario</a>, a childhood camping location our family would stay at. It's almost considered a family tradition to stay that campground and a lot of memories were created there, thus the creation of our name!</i><br><br>Our love for gerbils started quite spontaneously. We have had many rodents in the past and present but never gerbils until one trip to our local petstore we realized how adorable these little creatures can be!<br>
We decided to go the route of contacting a breeder, and thus our friendship and partnership with Caledonia Clan started! We adopted Pixie and Pebble as our first two gerbils we've ever owned and since then we've been in love!
With the help and guidance from Caledonia Clan, we started our own breeding project. We now look forward to breeding new colours, new lines and creating healthy and gorgeous gerbils. We also attend shows when we can and show some of our gerbils to attempt to gain champion lines.<br><br>
Rock Lake Gerbils is located in Oshawa, Ontario.<br>We are able to travel within the GTA for any kind of delivery but there are no guarantees. We ask that you contact us ahead of time to make arragements.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>Our goal is to have healthy and friendly gerbils for all types of families. Having a small animal that is non-aggressive, calm and easy to handle is what we strive to achieve. All of our gerbils will be handled at a young age and throughout their lives to promote tame and friendly attitudes. We make sure to breed healthy lines that includes no inbreeding or continuing a line with unfit temperments. Attitude and health come before anything else here at Rock Lake Gerbils.

<h3>Gerbil Habitat</h3>

<p>Our gerbils are housed in aqauriums with aspen shavings as bedding occassionally with corn cobs. We do not put our gerbils on anything else, although they are often given cardboard and paper rolls for chewing and that will eventually add to their home environment. We also give our gerbils timothy hay and sand bathes once a week.
<br><br>Tanks that have pregnant mothers and young pups will have lower bedding, but we will add more as they get older to encourage them to start to tunnel and dig.<br>
 <br>
Most of our gerbils are in 20 gallon tanks, depending on the situation we will have them in smaller or larger homes as well. <b>Never</b> in cages as you cannot give them ample shaving so they can dig and feel comfortable. The tanks are topped with mesh or wire lids to keep them save and allow plenty of air circulation.
<br><br>Their food consists of a mixture of seed mixes, lab blocks (12%-16% protein) and the occassional fresh and dried fruits. We also use cheerios and other nuts/seeds (sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, almonds) as treats.</p>
